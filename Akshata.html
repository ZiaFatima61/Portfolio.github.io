    <h3>Dairy Farm Smart Management</h3>
   
    <p>📍 Located in our newly developed Smart City </p>

 <p>🔹Purpose</p>
<p>To supply fresh, organic milk and dairy products to the residents of the city while ensuring animal welfare, automation, and high productivity using modern technologies.</p>
    
    <p>Indraprastha aims to improve agriculture while supporting the (SDGs) <span class="bright-text">Sustainable Development Goals</span> such as food security, good health, and employment. Dairy farming is very important because it provides milk, supports farmers, and improves nutrition. However, traditional dairy farms face problems like poor record keeping, difficulty in tracking cattle health, uneven milk production, and high management costs. A Smart Dairy Farm Management System helps solve these problems using data structures and algorithms. </p>
   
    <p>The system starts with collecting daily data such as milk quantity, feed intake, and health details of each cow. This data is stored using <span class="bright-text">Arrays and List</span>, which makes it easy to add and view records. Each cow is given a unique ID, and hashing is used to connect this ID to its records. <span class="bright-text">Hash table</span>s allow quick access to a cow’s data without searching the entire database.</p>
   
    <p>To organize the farm properly, the dairy is represented using a tree structure. The farm is the main node, cattle groups are sub-nodes, and individual cows are leaf nodes. This creates a clear hierarchy.<span class="bright-text">DFS</span> (Depth First Search) is used when detailed checking of cattle in one group is needed, while <span class="bright-text">BFS</span> (Breadth First Search) is used to monitor all cattle group by group. This helps in systematic inspection and management. </p>
    
    <p>To study milk production, sorting algorithms are used. <span class="bright-text">Merge Sort</span> is applied to sort cows based on milk yield because it works efficiently even for large data. After sorting, it becomes easy to identify cows that produce more or less milk. A <span class="bright-text">Heap</span> data structure is used to quickly find the highest milk-producing cows, which helps in better feeding and breeding decisions. </p>
   
    <p>For feed distribution, a Greedy Technique is used. The available feed is given first to cows that produce more milk so that overall milk production is increased. This approach helps in using resources efficiently without wastage. </p>
   
   
    <p>To calculate total milk production over a period of time, such as a week or a month, a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) is used. It allows fast calculation of milk quantity over a range of days. It is preferred over a <span class="bright-text">segment</span> Tree because it is simpler and easier to implement. </p>
   
    <p>Finally, milk collection routes are planned using a graph representation of the farm. Storage units and cattle sheds are treated as nodes, and paths between them are edges. <span class="bright-text">Dijkstra’s</span> Algorithm is used to find the shortest and fastest route for milk transportation, which saves time and fuel.</p>
   
    <p>By integrating trees, hashing, heaps, sorting algorithms, Fenwick Trees, greedy strategies, and shortest path algorithms, the Smart Dairy Farm Management System improves productivity, reduces operational inefficiencies, and supports sustainable agricultural development. </p>

    <h3>Beekeeping & Honey Production</h3>

    <p>📍 Located in our newly developed Smart City </p>
   
    <p>Indraprastha aims to support sustainable agriculture and biodiversity while aligning with the  <span class="bright-text">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</span> such as food security, good health, and decent work. Beekeeping is very important because it supports honey production, helps in pollination of crops, protects biodiversity, and provides income to farmers. However, traditional beekeeping faces problems such as irregular honey yield, difficulty in monitoring hive health, poor harvesting decisions, and lack of proper data management. A Smart Beekeeping and Honey Production System helps solve these problems using data structures and algorithms. </p>
    <p>The system begins with collecting data from each beehive, such as temperature, humidity, bee activity, and honey level. This data is stored using  <span class="bright-text">arrays and lists</span> , which makes it easy to update daily records. Each beehive is given a unique ID, and  <span class="bright-text">hashing</span>  (hash tables) is used to link the hive ID with its health and production data. This allows quick access to hive information without searching through all records. </p>
    <p>To manage multiple beehives efficiently, the beekeeping area is represented as a   <span class="bright-text">graph</span>   structure. Each beehive is treated as a node, and nearby hives are connected using edges. <span class="bright-text">BFS</span>  (Breadth First Search) is used to regularly monitor all hives level by level. This helps beekeepers quickly identify unhealthy or inactive hives and take timely action. </p>
    <p>Honey types, quality grades, and product categories are stored using a <span class="bright-text">Trie</span>   data structure. Tries allow fast searching and classification of honey based on names or prefixes, which is useful for labeling, packaging, and marketing different honey products. </p>
    <p>Environmental data such as temperature and humidity patterns are stored in a  <span class="bright-text">lookup table</span>  . Since this data is pre-computed, it can be accessed quickly whenever needed. This helps in making fast decisions related to hive maintenance and harvesting conditions. </p>
    <p>To decide the best time for honey harvesting, a <span class="bright-text"> Greedy Algorithm</span>  is used. The system selec
      ts the harvesting time that gives the maximum immediate honey yield while maintaining hive health. This approach ensures efficient use of resources and prevents over-harvesting. </p>
    <p>For predicting future honey production, <span class="bright-text"> Dynamic Programming </span>  is applied. Past seasonal data is used to estimate future yield, helping farmers plan storage, pricing, and sales in advance. This reduces uncertainty and improves long-term productivity. </p>
    <p>By using graphs, BFS, hashing, tries, lookup tables, greedy techniques, and dynamic programming, the Smart Beekeeping System improves hive management, increases honey quality, and ensures sustainable and profitable honey production. </p>
