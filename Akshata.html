    <h3>Dairy Farm Smart Management</h3>
   
    <p>📍 Located in our newly developed Smart City </p>

 <p>🔹Purpose</p>
<p>To supply fresh, organic milk and dairy products to the residents of the city while ensuring animal welfare, automation, and high productivity using modern technologies.</p>
    
    <p>Indraprastha aims to improve agriculture while supporting the (SDGs) <span class="bright-text">Sustainable Development Goals</span> such as food security, good health, and employment. Dairy farming is very important because it provides milk, supports farmers, and improves nutrition. However, traditional dairy farms face problems like poor record keeping, difficulty in tracking cattle health, uneven milk production, and high management costs. A Smart Dairy Farm Management System helps solve these problems using data structures and algorithms. </p>
   
    <p>The system starts with collecting daily data such as milk quantity, feed intake, and health details of each cow. This data is stored using <span class="bright-text">Arrays and List</span>, which makes it easy to add and view records. Each cow is given a unique ID, and hashing is used to connect this ID to its records. <span class="bright-text">Hash table</span>s allow quick access to a cow’s data without searching the entire database.</p>
   
    <p>To organize the farm properly, the dairy is represented using a tree structure. The farm is the main node, cattle groups are sub-nodes, and individual cows are leaf nodes. This creates a clear hierarchy.<span class="bright-text">DFS</span> (Depth First Search) is used when detailed checking of cattle in one group is needed, while <span class="bright-text">BFS</span> (Breadth First Search) is used to monitor all cattle group by group. This helps in systematic inspection and management. </p>
    
    <p>To study milk production, sorting algorithms are used. <span class="bright-text">Merge Sort</span> is applied to sort cows based on milk yield because it works efficiently even for large data. After sorting, it becomes easy to identify cows that produce more or less milk. A <span class="bright-text">Heap</span> data structure is used to quickly find the highest milk-producing cows, which helps in better feeding and breeding decisions. </p>
   
    <p>For feed distribution, a Greedy Technique is used. The available feed is given first to cows that produce more milk so that overall milk production is increased. This approach helps in using resources efficiently without wastage. </p>
   
   
    <p>To calculate total milk production over a period of time, such as a week or a month, a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) is used. It allows fast calculation of milk quantity over a range of days. It is preferred over a <span class="bright-text">segment</span> Tree because it is simpler and easier to implement. </p>
   
    <p>Finally, milk collection routes are planned using a graph representation of the farm. Storage units and cattle sheds are treated as nodes, and paths between them are edges. <span class="bright-text">Dijkstra’s</span> Algorithm is used to find the shortest and fastest route for milk transportation, which saves time and fuel.</p>
   
    <p>By integrating trees, hashing, heaps, sorting algorithms, Fenwick Trees, greedy strategies, and shortest path algorithms, the Smart Dairy Farm Management System improves productivity, reduces operational inefficiencies, and supports sustainable agricultural development. </p>

    <h3>Beekeeping & Honey Production</h3>

    <p>📍 Located in our newly developed Smart City </p>
   
    <p>Indraprastha aims to support sustainable agriculture and biodiversity while aligning with the  <span class="bright-text">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</span> such as food security, good health, and decent work. Beekeeping is very important because it supports honey production, helps in pollination of crops, protects biodiversity, and provides income to farmers. However, traditional beekeeping faces problems such as irregular honey yield, difficulty in monitoring hive health, poor harvesting decisions, and lack of proper data management. A Smart Beekeeping and Honey Production System helps solve these problems using data structures and algorithms. </p>
    <p>The system begins with collecting data from each beehive, such as temperature, humidity, bee activity, and honey level. This data is stored using  <span class="bright-text">arrays and lists</span> , which makes it easy to update daily records. Each beehive is given a unique ID, and  <span class="bright-text">hashing</span>  (hash tables) is used to link the hive ID with its health and production data. This allows quick access to hive information without searching through all records. </p>
    <p>To manage multiple beehives efficiently, the beekeeping area is represented as a   <span class="bright-text">graph</span>   structure. Each beehive is treated as a node, and nearby hives are connected using edges. <span class="bright-text">BFS</span>  (Breadth First Search) is used to regularly monitor all hives level by level. This helps beekeepers quickly identify unhealthy or inactive hives and take timely action. </p>
    <p>Honey types, quality grades, and product categories are stored using a <span class="bright-text">Trie</span>   data structure. Tries allow fast searching and classification of honey based on names or prefixes, which is useful for labeling, packaging, and marketing different honey products. </p>
    <p>Environmental data such as temperature and humidity patterns are stored in a  <span class="bright-text">lookup table</span>  . Since this data is pre-computed, it can be accessed quickly whenever needed. This helps in making fast decisions related to hive maintenance and harvesting conditions. </p>
    <p>To decide the best time for honey harvesting, a <span class="bright-text"> Greedy Algorithm</span>  is used. The system selec
      ts the harvesting time that gives the maximum immediate honey yield while maintaining hive health. This approach ensures efficient use of resources and prevents over-harvesting. </p>
    <p>For predicting future honey production, <span class="bright-text"> Dynamic Programming </span>  is applied. Past seasonal data is used to estimate future yield, helping farmers plan storage, pricing, and sales in advance. This reduces uncertainty and improves long-term productivity. </p>
    <p>By using graphs, BFS, hashing, tries, lookup tables, greedy techniques, and dynamic programming, the Smart Beekeeping System improves hive management, increases honey quality, and ensures sustainable and profitable honey production. </p>

    <h3>Mushroom Cultivation</h3>
    <p>
      Indoor farming using controlled humidity, temperature, and CO₂ levels
      to achieve high mushroom yield with minimal space.
    </p>
    <p>📍 Located in our newly developed Smart City </p>
     
     <p>Indoor farming using controlled humidity, temperature, and CO₂ levels
      to achieve high mushroom yield with minimal space.
    </p>
    
     <p>Indraprastha aims to strengthen sustainable agriculture while supporting the  <span class="bright-text">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</span>  such as zero hunger, good health, and decent work. Mushroom cultivation is an important agricultural activity because it provides nutritious food, requires less land, and generates income for farmers. However, traditional mushroom cultivation faces problems such as poor environmental control, irregular growth, crop spoilage, and financial loss. A Smart Mushroom Cultivation System helps overcome these issues using efficient data structures and algorithms </p>
     <p>The system begins by collecting environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and moisture levels at regular intervals. This data is stored using  <span class="bright-text">arrays and lists </span>  , where insertion and access operations take <span class="bright-text">O(1) </span>  time, making them suitable for frequent sensor updates. Each growing chamber is assigned a unique ID, and <span class="bright-text"> hashing</span> is used to map this ID to its data, allowing fast access in <span class="bright-text">O(1) average </span> time without scanning all records. </p>
     <p>To continuously monitor recent environmental conditions, a  <span class="bright-text">sliding window </span>  technique is applied to time-based data. This technique processes the data in  <span class="bright-text"> O(n)</span>  time overall, as each reading enters and exits the window only once. It helps detect sudden changes in conditions efficiently, ensuring timely corrective actions. </p>
     <p>For answering range-based queries such as total or average temperature over several days, a <span class="bright-text">Fenwick Tree </span>  (Binary Indexed Tree) is used. The  <span class="bright-text"></span>  Fenwick Tree supports updates and queries in <span class="bright-text">O(log n) </span> time, which is efficient for frequent calculations and is chosen over Segment Trees due to simpler implementation and lower memory usage. </p>
     <p>Daily growth and yield data are sorted using Sort <span class="bright-text"> Insertion</span>  , which runs in  <span class="bright-text">O(n²)</span>  time in the  <span class="bright-text">worst case</span>  but performs efficiently for small and nearly sorted datasets, making it suitable for daily cultivation records. <span class="bright-text"> Greedy techniques</span> are used to allocate water and nutrients, ensuring optimal resource usage by making locally optimal decisions at each step with minimal computation. </p>
     <p>To manage different growth stages, the cultivation process is represented using a  <span class="bright-text"> tree</span>  structure. <span class="bright-text"> DFS </span> (Depth First Search) is used for detailed inspection of a specific growth stage, while <span class="bright-text"> BFS</span>  (Breadth First Search) is used for level-wise monitoring. Both traversal techniques operate in <span class="bright-text"> O(V + E)</span> time, ensuring efficient inspection even as the system scales. </p>
     <p>By combining constant-time data access, logarithmic-time range queries, and linear-time monitoring techniques, the Smart Mushroom Cultivation System achieves high efficiency, reduces losses, and improves overall productivity. </p>

    <h3>Café & Mini Mart + delivery system</h3>

     s<p>📍 Located in our newly developed Smart City </p>
    
     <p> A small community café + mini mart offering fresh snacks, beverages,
      and smart inventory monitoring for daily needs.
    </p>
    
    <p>Indraprastha aims to improve urban convenience while supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as decent work, sustainable cities, and economic growth. A Café and Mini Mart is important because it provides daily essentials, food, and employment to local residents. However, traditional cafés and small shops face problems like poor inventory management, long waiting times, inefficient billing, and delayed deliveries. A Smart Café & Mini Mart System helps solve these issues using data structures and algorithms. </p>
    <p>Customer orders are received and managed using a <span class="bright-text"> Queue </span> data structure, which follows the  <span class="bright-text">First-In-First-Out </span> (FIFO) principle. This ensures fair order processing and reduces waiting time. Enqueue and dequeue operations take <span class="bright-text"> O(1)</span> time, making queues efficient even during peak hours. </p>
    <p>Product inventory is managed using <span class="bright-text"> Hash</span> Tables, where each product ID is mapped to its stock details. Hashing allows fast access, update, and deletion in <span class="bright-text">O(1) average</span> time, preventing delays caused by searching through long lists. This helps maintain accurate stock levels and avoid shortages. </p>
    <p>Sales data is analyzed using <span class="bright-text">Sorting</span>  Algorithms such as <span class="bright-text">Merge Sort</span>, which sorts products based on demand or sales volume in <span class="bright-text">O(n log n) </span> time. Sorting helps identify fast-moving and slow-moving items efficiently, enabling better restocking decisions.</p>
    <p>For identifying the most popular items quickly, a <span class="bright-text"> Heap </span> data structure is used. A Max <span class="bright-text"> Heap</span> allows retrieval of the highest-selling products in <span class="bright-text">O(1) </span> time and insertion or deletion in O(log n) time. This improves promotional planning and menu optimization. </p>
    <p>Home delivery routes are planned using a <span class="bright-text">Graph </span> representation, where delivery locations are nodes and roads are edges. <span class="bright-text"> Dijkstra’s</span>  Algorithm is applied to find the shortest delivery paths, operating in <span class="bright-text"> O(E log V) </span> time. This reduces delivery time, fuel usage, and operational costs. </p>
    <p>By using queues, hashing, sorting, heaps, and shortest path algorithms, the Smart Café & Mini Mart System improves service speed, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.</p>

    <p>
      A nursery with automated irrigation, growth tracking, and online ordering
      for gardeners, landscapers, and home plant lovers.
    </p>
    
    <p>Indraprastha focuses on environmental sustainability and green development in line with SDGs such as climate action, life on land, and sustainable cities. Plant nurseries are important because they support greenery, improve air quality, and provide employment. However, traditional nurseries face problems like poor plant tracking, difficulty in managing different plant types, irregular watering schedules, and inefficient space usage. A Smart Plant Nursery Management System solves these problems using data structures and algorithms.</p>
     <p>Each plant is assigned a unique ID, and plant details such as type, age, and growth stage are stored using <span class="bright-text"> Arrays and Lists</span>, which allow easy insertion and traversal in <span class="bright-text">O(1) </span> and <span class="bright-text">O(n)</span>  time respectively. For fast searching of plant categories and names, a Trie data structure is used. <span class="bright-text">Trie</span>  enables prefix-based searching in <span class="bright-text">O(L)</span>  time, where L is the length of the plant name, making it efficient for large plant catalogs.</p>
    <p>The nursery layout is represented as a  <span class="bright-text">Tree</span> structure, where the nursery is the root node, sections are intermediate nodes, and individual plants are leaf nodes.<span class="bright-text"> DFS (Depth First Search)</span>  is used for detailed inspection of plants in a particular section, while <span class="bright-text">BFS</span>  (Breadth First Search) is used for level-wise monitoring. Both <span class="bright-text"> DFS and BFS run in O(V + E) </span>time, ensuring efficient traversal of the nursery structure.</p>
     <p>Watering and fertilizer distribution use a <span class="bright-text">Greedy </span> Algorithm, where plants with higher water or nutrient requirements are given priority. This <span class="bright-text"> greedy</span>  approach runs in <span class="bright-text">O(n)</span>  time and ensures optimal resource usage without wastage.</p>
     <p> Plant growth data over time is stored using a Tree <span class="bright-text"> Fenwick</span> (Binary Indexed Tree), which allows fast range queries and updates in <span class="bright-text">O(log n)</span> time. It is chosen over Segment Tree due to its simpler implementation and lower memory usage.</p>
